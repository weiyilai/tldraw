This release adds a consolidated `options` prop, quick zoom navigation, a fill styles dropdown, a new `TldrawUiSelect` component, and shape-aware binding checks. It also includes 2D canvas rendering for shape indicators, R-tree spatial indexing, telestrator-style laser behavior, significant performance improvements for large canvases, and various bug fixes.

## What's new

### 2D canvas rendering for shape indicators ([#7708](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7708))

Shape indicators (selection outlines, hover states) now render using a 2D canvas instead of SVG elements. This significantly improves performance when selecting or hovering over many shapes, with up to 25x faster rendering in some scenarios.

Custom shapes can opt into canvas indicators by implementing the new `getIndicatorPath()` method on their ShapeUtil, and marking `useLegactIndicator` to return false:

```tsx
class MyShapeUtil extends ShapeUtil<MyShape> {
	getIndicatorPath(shape: MyShape): TLIndicatorPath | undefined {
		return {
			path: new Path2D(),
			// optional clip path for complex shapes like arrows with labels
		}
	}

	// Return false to use the new canvas indicators (default is true for backwards compatibility)
	useLegacyIndicator(): boolean {
		return false
	}
}
```

### Quick zoom navigation ([#7801](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7801), [#7836](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7836))

Press `z` then hold Shift to zoom out and see the whole canvas ("eagle eye" view). A viewport brush appears showing where you'll zoom to. Move the cursor to pick a location and release Shift to zoom there. Press Escape to cancel and return to the original view.

### Fill styles dropdown ([#7885](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7885))

The style panel now exposes additional fill styles (pattern, fill, lined-fill) through a dropdown picker after the solid button. The first three fill options (none, semi, solid) remain as inline buttons.

### User preference: Invert mouse wheel zoom direction ([#7732](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7732))

Added a new user preference to invert mouse wheel zoom direction. Some users prefer "natural" scrolling behavior where scrolling down zooms out, which this option now enables.

Access it via Menu → Preferences → Input device → Invert mouse zoom.

### Performance improvements ([#7676](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7676), [#7826](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7826), [#7840](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7840), [#7657](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7657))

This release includes several performance improvements for large canvases:

- **R-tree spatial indexing**: Shape queries now use an R-tree (RBush) for O(log n) lookups instead of O(n) iteration, significantly improving brushing, scribble selection, and erasing with many shapes on the canvas. The spatial index is maintained internally and accessed through existing methods like `editor.getShapesAtPoint()` and `editor.getShapeAtPoint()`.
- **Faster panning**: Hover hit-testing is now skipped during camera movement, reducing work while panning through large documents.
- **Reduced allocations**: Optimized Set comparisons, reduced memory allocations, and added string hash caching for better performance in large canvases and multiplayer rooms.
- **Smarter network scheduling**: Solo-mode network traffic is reduced by throttling to 1 FPS when no collaborators are present.

### Re-designed laser pointer ([#7681](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7681))

The laser pointer now behaves like a telestrator: all strokes remain visible while you're drawing and fade together when you stop. Previously, each stroke segment would fade independently, creating a trailing effect.

This is powered by a new generic session system on `ScribbleManager`. Sessions group multiple scribbles together and control how they fade:

```tsx
// Start a grouped session (used internally by the laser tool)
const sessionId = editor.scribbles.startSession({
	fadeMode: 'grouped',
	idleTimeoutMs: 1200,
	fadeDurationMs: 500,
})

// Add scribbles and points to a session
editor.scribbles.addScribbleToSession(sessionId, { color: 'laser' })
editor.scribbles.addPointToSession(sessionId, scribbleId, x, y)

// Stop or clear a session
editor.scribbles.stopSession(sessionId)
editor.scribbles.clearSession(sessionId)
```

New option in `TldrawOptions`:

- `laserFadeoutMs` (default: 500ms) - How long to fade all laser scribbles after the session ends

### Image pipeline starter template ([#7863](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7863))

A new "Image pipeline" starter template is available via `npx create-tldraw`. It provides a visual node-based canvas for building AI image generation workflows, with custom node shapes, typed port connections, pipeline regions with play/stop controls, and a DAG-based execution engine backed by a Cloudflare Worker API.

### Agent starter template improvements ([#7640](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7640))

The agent starter template has been restructured around a manager-based architecture for better modularity and extensibility. It now includes a mode system for controlling agent capabilities per mode, action schema registries, prompt part definitions, canvas linting, and user action tracking. The template also renames "SimpleShape" to "FocusedShape" for clarity.

### TldrawUiSelect component ([#7566](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7566))

New select dropdown primitive wrapping Radix UI's Select, following existing tldraw UI patterns.

### 🔜 Consolidated options prop ([#7888](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7888))

The `cameraOptions`, `textOptions`, and `deepLinks` props on `Tldraw`, `TldrawEditor`, and `TldrawImage` are now consolidated into the `options` prop. The standalone props are deprecated but still work for backward compatibility.

```tsx
// Before
<Tldraw cameraOptions={{ isLocked: true }} deepLinks textOptions={{ ... }} />

// After
<Tldraw options={{ camera: { isLocked: true }, deepLinks: true, text: { ... } }} />
```

<details>
<summary>Migration guide</summary>

Replace standalone props with equivalent `options` fields:

- `cameraOptions={...}` → `options={{ camera: { ... } }}`
- `textOptions={...}` → `options={{ text: { ... } }}`
- `deepLinks` or `deepLinks={...}` → `options={{ deepLinks: true }}` or `options={{ deepLinks: { ... } }}`

The deprecated props still work. When both the deprecated prop and the `options` field are provided, the `options` value takes precedence.
