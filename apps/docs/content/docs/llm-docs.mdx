The tldraw docs are optimized for use with large language models (LLMs). Whether you're using an AI coding assistant, building an agent that works with tldraw, or prompting a chat model, you can access our documentation in formats designed for LLM consumption.

## llms.txt

We publish our documentation at [tldraw.dev/llms.txt](https://tldraw.dev/llms.txt), following the [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/) for providing LLM-friendly content. This file serves as an index to all SDK documentation, examples, and release notes.

The index includes links to several focused exports:

| File                                                      | Contents                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [llms.txt](https://tldraw.dev/llms.txt)                   | Index with links to all resources    |
| [llms-full.txt](https://tldraw.dev/llms-full.txt)         | All SDK docs, releases, and examples |
| [llms-docs.txt](https://tldraw.dev/llms-docs.txt)         | SDK feature documentation only       |
| [llms-releases.txt](https://tldraw.dev/llms-releases.txt) | Release notes only                   |
| [llms-examples.txt](https://tldraw.dev/llms-examples.txt) | Examples with full source code       |

### Using llms.txt with AI assistants

When working with an AI coding assistant, you can provide context by including the relevant llms.txt file in your prompt or conversation. For example:

- Use `llms-docs.txt` when asking about SDK features, APIs, or implementation patterns
- Use `llms-examples.txt` when looking for code examples or implementation references
- Use `llms-releases.txt` when asking about recent changes or migration between versions
- Use `llms-full.txt` when you need comprehensive context across all documentation

Many AI tools support fetching URLs directly, so you can reference these files by URL in your prompts.

## Copy markdown button

Every documentation page on tldraw.dev includes a "Copy markdown" button in the header. Click it to copy the page content as clean markdown, ready to paste into any LLM conversation.

This is useful when you want to:

- Ask an AI assistant about a specific feature
- Include documentation context in a prompt
- Reference our docs in your own documentation or notes

The copied markdown preserves headings, code blocks, links, and other formatting while removing site-specific elements that aren't relevant in a plain text context.

## Building AI-powered apps

If you're building AI-powered applications with tldraw, see our [AI integrations](/docs/ai) guide. It covers patterns for using the canvas with AI models, including:

- Using the canvas to display AI-generated content
- Building visual workflows with AI nodes
- Creating AI agents that can read and manipulate the canvas
